Hi! This repository is for random bits of code I've  been working on.
Very basic Python at the moment, I'm still learning!
The majority of this code will be maths/science based, that's what I 
enjoy doing and also Python is the best language to 
do these things in!
Any comments/advice would be much appreciated.

Enjoy,
      Tom
